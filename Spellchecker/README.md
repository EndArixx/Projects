#Spellcheck
This Folder contains a spell checker written in Python 
(This program was written using python 2.7 on a Linux: Ubuntu 12.04)

Spellcheck.py is the final program.

Instructions
  Type "Python Spellcheck.py" to run the program 
    (this command is for a linux computer)
    please allow time for the program to generate the BKtree of data
  once the BKtree has been generated you can type words to see if they exist and to get similar words.
  when finished type "quit"
  
  I also inluded a copy of my levenstein program(lev.py). 
    this was the first step when making the spellcheck program, but is not neccesary for running the SpellCheck program.
